### Description of the data set

The data used for analysis we could either fetch using World Bank API or using "wbdata" library. In pyhon we have API based library "wbdata" that hits world bank server and fetch the data so in this project i have used wbdata library to gather data. After importing data my first step was to craete my own dataframe for selected years and 16 defiined parameters. i took data from year 2015 to 2020 because i have seen this data and it was not updated for some couple of parameters after 2020.
that why i took the analysis period form 2015 to 2020.
